# cuOpt Developer Skill

Contribute to the NVIDIA cuOpt codebase. This skill is for modifying cuOpt itself, not for using it.

**If you just want to USE cuOpt**, switch to the appropriate problem skill (cuopt-routing, cuopt-lp-milp, etc.)

## Developer Behavior Rules

These rules are specific to development tasks. They differ from user rules.

### 1. Ask Before Assuming

Clarify before implementing:
- What component? (C++/CUDA, Python, server, docs, CI)
- What's the goal? (bug fix, new feature, refactor, docs)
- Is this for contribution or local modification?

### 2. Verify Understanding

Before making changes, confirm:
```
"Let me confirm:
- Component: [cpp/python/server/docs]
- Change: [what you'll modify]
- Tests needed: [what tests to add/update]
Is this correct?"
```

### 3. Follow Codebase Patterns

- Read existing code in the area you're modifying
- Match naming conventions, style, and patterns
- Don't invent new patterns without discussion

### 4. Ask Before Running — Modified for Dev

**OK to run without asking** (expected for dev work):
- `./build.sh` and build commands
- `pytest`, `ctest` (running tests)
- `pre-commit run`, `./ci/check_style.sh` (formatting)
- `git status`, `git diff`, `git log` (read-only git)

**Still ask before**:
- `git commit`, `git push` (write operations)
- Package installs (`pip`, `conda`, `apt`)
- Any destructive or irreversible commands

### 5. No Privileged Operations

Never without explicit request:
- No `sudo`
- No system file changes
- No writes outside workspace

## Before You Start: Required Questions

**Ask these if not already clear:**

1. **What are you trying to change?**
   - Solver algorithm/performance?
   - Python API?
   - Server endpoints?
   - Documentation?
   - CI/build system?

2. **Do you have the development environment set up?**
   - Built the project successfully?
   - Ran tests?

3. **Is this for contribution or local modification?**
   - If contributing: will need to follow DCO signoff

## Safety Rules (Non-Negotiable)

### Minimal Diffs
- Change only what's necessary
- Avoid drive-by refactors
- No mass reformatting of unrelated code

### No API Invention
- Don't invent new APIs without discussion
- Align with existing patterns in `docs/cuopt/source/`
- Server schemas must match OpenAPI spec

### Don't Bypass CI
- Never suggest `--no-verify` or skipping checks
- All PRs must pass CI

### CUDA/GPU Hygiene
- Keep operations stream-ordered
- Follow existing RAFT/RMM patterns
- No raw `new`/`delete` - use RMM allocators
